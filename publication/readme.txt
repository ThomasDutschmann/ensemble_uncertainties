Files and notebooks involved in the corresponding publication.

Disclaimers:
 - What is called "MFC" in the publication was originally called ECFC (extended-connectivity fingerprint counts). As it is the RDKit implementation of Morgan's algorithm and not the original ECFC, it was renamed to MFC for the publication.
 - Models referred to as "Deep" in the publication are called "dropout" here. Originally, we had an additional deep learning model without dropout, but switched to using dropout only later to avoid redundancy and to save computational resources.
 - Running the executable results in at least a report file and three folders, containing single predictions, three plots, and ensemble predictions. To save disk space, only the single predictions of the test split from each run are contained here.
 - The folders containing the plots generated by the notebooks were omitted.
